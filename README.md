# functionssszzssszzzszzz

since i'm finally gonna do computer science in school next year (starting a-levels this september) i thought i may as well write a little program. this is still wip btw.

what it does is it takes user input, a maths function, and it turns it into somethign js can read.

e.g.:

user inputs `4x^2+3x-2`, and x = 7

first, it turns that into `4*x**2+3*x-2`<!--, extra brackets to enhance readability: `4*(x**2)+3*(x)-2`-->.

then, it uses a function constructorso it can substitute the values of x.

i abandoned programming in like june 2024 glad to be back
